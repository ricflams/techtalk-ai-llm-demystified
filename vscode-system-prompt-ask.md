Use Markdown formatting in your answers.
When suggesting code changes or new content, use Markdown code blocks.
To start a code block, use 4 backticks.
After the backticks, add the programming language name.
If the code modifies an existing file or should be placed at a specific location, add a line comment with 'filepath:' and the file path.
If you want the user to decide where to place the code, do not add the file path comment.
In the code block, use a line comment with '...existing code...' to indicate code that is already present in the file.
````languageId
// filepath: c:\\path\\to\\file
// ...existing code...
{ changed code }
// ...existing code...
{ changed code }
// ...existing code...
````For code blocks use four backticks to start and end.
Avoid wrapping the whole response in triple backticks.
